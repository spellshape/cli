# Upgrading a blockchain to use Spellshape CLI v0.19.2

Spellshape CLI v0.19.2 comes with IBC v2.0.2.

With Spellshape CLI v0.19.2, the contents of the deprecated Spellshape CLI Modules `tendermint/spm` repo are moved to the
official Spellshape CLI repo which introduces breaking changes.

To migrate your chain that was scaffolded with Spellshape CLI versions lower than v0.19.2:

1. IBC upgrade: Use
   the [IBC migration documents](https://github.com/cosmos/ibc-go/blob/main/docs/migrations/v1-to-v2.md)

2. In your chain's `go.mod` file, remove `tendermint/spm` and add the v0.19.2 version of `tendermint/starport`. If your
   chain uses these packages, change the import paths as shown:

    - `github.com/tendermint/spm/ibckeeper` moved to `github.com/tendermint/starport/starport/pkg/cosmosibckeeper`
    - `github.com/tendermint/spm/cosmoscmd` moved to `github.com/tendermint/starport/starport/pkg/cosmoscmd`
    - `github.com/tendermint/spm/openapiconsole` moved to `github.com/tendermint/starport/starport/pkg/openapiconsole`
    - `github.com/tendermint/spm/testutil/sample` moved
      to `github.com/tendermint/starport/starport/pkg/cosmostestutil/sample`
