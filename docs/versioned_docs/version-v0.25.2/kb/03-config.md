# config.yml reference

The `config.yml` file generated in your blockchain folder uses key-value pairs to describe the development environment for your blockchain.

Only a default set of parameters is provided. If more nuanced configuration is required, you can add these parameters to the `config.yml` file.

## accounts

A list of user accounts created during genesis of the blockchain.

| Key      | Required | Type            | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------- | -------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name     | Y        | String          | Local name of a key pair. An account name must be listed to gain access to the account tokens after the blockchain is launched. |
| coins    | Y        | List of Strings | Initial coins with denominations. For example, "1000token"                                                                      |
| address  | N        | String          | Account address in Bech32 address format.                                                                                       |
| mnemonic | N        | String          | Mnemonic used to generate an account. This field is ignored if `address` is specified.                                          |

Note that you can only use `address` OR `mnemonic` for an account. You can't use both, because an address is derived from a mnemonic.

If an account is a validator account (`alice` by default), it cannot have an `address` field.

**accounts example**

```yaml
accounts:
  - name: alice
    coins: ["1000token", "100000000stake"]
  - name: bob
    coins: ["500token"]
    address: cosmos1adn9gxjmrc3hrsdx5zpc9sj2ra7kgqkmphf8yw
```

| third_party_paths | N        | List of Strings | Path to third-party protocol buffer files. Default: `["third_party/proto", "proto_vendor"]`. |

## client

Configures and enables client code generation. To prevent Spellshape CLI from regenerating the client, remove the `client` property.

### client.vuex

```yaml
client:
  vuex:
    path: "vue/src/store"
```

Generates Vuex stores for the blockchain in `path` on `serve` and `build` commands.

### client.typescript

```yaml
client:
  typescript:
    path: "vue/src/generated"
```

Generates TypeScript clients for the blockchain in `path` on `serve` and `build` commands.

### client.openapi

```yaml
client:
  openapi:
    path: "docs/static/openapi.yml"
```

Generates OpenAPI YAML file in `path`. By default this file is embedded in the node's binary.

## faucet

## validator

## init.home

The path to the data directory that stores blockchain data and blockchain configuration.
