description: For chains that were scaffolded with Spellshape CLI versions lower than v0.25.0. changes are required to use Spellshape CLI v0.24.0.

## Protobuf directory migration

`v0.25.0` changes the location of scaffolded `.proto` files.  Previously, `.proto` files were located in `./proto/{moduleName}/`, 
where `moduleName` is the same name of the Cosmos SDK module found in `./x/{moduleName}/`.  This new version of `spellshape`
modifies the scaffolded protobuf files so that they are now generated in `.proto/{appName}/{moduleName}`.  

The only change that is needed to be made is to create an `appName` folder in the `proto` directory, and then place the 
sub-directories within it.  An example below demonstrates this change:

### Previous Directory Structure

This example shows a chain that was generated using `spellshape` with `v0.24.0` using the following command:

```bash
spellshape s chain github.com/cosmos/planet --no-module
spellshape s module mars
```

```bash
├── app  
├── cmd
├── docs
├── proto
│   ├── mars
├── x
│   ├── mars
├── README.md
├── config.yml
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── .gitignore
```

### `v0.25.0` Directory Structure

This example shows a chain that was generated using `spellshape` with `v0.25.0` using the following command:

```bash
spellshape s chain github.com/cosmos/planet --no-module
spellshape s module mars
```

```bash
├── app  
├── cmd
├── docs
├── proto
│   ├── planet
│   │   ├── mars
├── x
│   ├── mars
├── README.md
├── config.yml
├── go.mod
├── go.sum
└── .gitignore
```

The only difference is the additional directory `planet` which is the name of the application.  The name of the app can 
be verified by checking the package in the `go.mod` file.  In this example, the package is `github.com/cosmos/planet` where
`planet` is the app name.
