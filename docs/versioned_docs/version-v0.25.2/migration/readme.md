# Migration Guides

Welcome to the section on upgrading to a newer version of Spellshape CLI! If you're
looking to update to the latest version, you'll want to start by checking the
documentation to see if there are any special considerations or instructions you
need to follow.

If there is no documentation for the latest version of Spellshape CLI, it's
generally safe to assume that there were no breaking changes, and you can
proceed with using the latest version with your project.
