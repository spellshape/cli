# Build a blog

In this tutorial, you create a blockchain with a module that lets you write to and read data from the blockchain. This module implements create and read functionalities for a blog-like application. The end user will be able to submit new blog posts and show a list of blog posts on the blockchain.

> The purpose of this tutorial is to guide you through the implementation of a complete feedback loop: submitting data and reading this data back from the blockchain.

By completing this tutorial, you will learn about:

* Scaffolding a Cosmos SDK message
* Defining new types in protocol buffer files
* Implementing keeper methods to write data to the store
* Reading data from the store and return it as a result of a query
* Using the blockchain's CLI to broadcast transactions and query the blockchain

**Note:** All the functions in this chapter can be scaffolded with a single command but instead you will learn how to add each functionality individually. 

## Prerequisites 

This series of blog tutorials is based on a specific version of Spellshape CLI, so to install Spellshape CLI v0.22.2 use the following command:

```bash
curl https://get.spellshape.com/cli@v0.22.2! | bash
```

## Create your blog chain

First, create a new blockchain.

Open a terminal and navigate to a directory where you have permissions to create files. To create your Cosmos SDK blockchain, run this command:

```bash
spellshape scaffold chain blog --address-prefix blog
```

The `blog` directory is created with the default directory structure.

The new blockchain is scaffolded with the `--address-prefix blog` flag to use "blog" instead of the default "cosmos" address prefix.

## High-level transaction review

So far, you have learned how to modify proto files to define a new API endpoint and modify a keeper query function to return static data back to the user. Of course, a keeper can do more than return a string of data. Its purpose is to manage access to the state of the blockchain.

You can think of the state as being a collection of key-value stores. Each module is responsible for its own store. Changes to the store are triggered by transactions that are signed and broadcasted by users. Each transaction contains Cosmos SDK messages (not to be confused with proto `message`). When a transaction is processed, each message gets routed to its module. A module has message handlers that process messages. Processing a message can trigger changes in the state.

## Create message types

A Cosmos SDK message contains information that can trigger changes in the state of a blockchain.

First, change into the `blog` directory:

```bash
cd blog
```

To create a message type and its handler, use the `message` command:

```bash
spellshape scaffold message createPost title body
```

The `message` command accepts message name (`createPost`) and a list of fields (`title` and `body`) as arguments.

The `message` command has created and modified several files:

```
modify proto/blog/tx.proto
modify x/blog/client/cli/tx.go
create x/blog/client/cli/tx_create_post.go
create x/blog/keeper/msg_server_create_post.go
modify x/blog/module_simulation.go
create x/blog/simulation/create_post.go
modify x/blog/types/codec.go
create x/blog/types/message_create_post.go
create x/blog/types/message_create_post_test.go

ðŸŽ‰ Created a message `createPost`.
```

As always, start with a proto file. Inside the `proto/blog/tx.proto` file, the `MsgCreatePost` message has been created. Edit the file to add the line that defines the `id` for `message MsgCreatePostResponse`:

```protobuf
message MsgCreatePost {
  string creator = 1;
  string title = 2;
  string body = 3;
}

message MsgCreatePostResponse {
  uint64 id = 1;
}
```

## Review the message code

Review the Cosmos SDK message type with proto `message`. The `MsgCreatePost` has three fields: creator, title, and body. Since the purpose of the `MsgCreatePost` message is to create new posts in the store, the only thing the message needs to return is an ID of a created post. The `CreatePost` rpc was already added to the `Msg` service:

```protobuf
service Msg {
  rpc CreatePost(MsgCreatePost) returns (MsgCreatePostResponse);
}
```

## Define messages logic

In the newly scaffolded `x/blog/keeper/msg_server_create_post.go` file, you can see a placeholder implementation of the `CreatePost` function. Right now it does nothing and returns an empty response. For your blog chain, you want the contents of the message (title and body) to be written to the state as a new post.

You need to do two things:

- Create a variable of type `Post` with title and body from the message
- Append this `Post` to the store

```go
func (k msgServer) CreatePost(goCtx context.Context, msg *types.MsgCreatePost) (*types.MsgCreatePostResponse, error) {
	// Get the context
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)

	// Create variable of type Post
	var post = types.Post{
		Creator: msg.Creator,
		Title:   msg.Title,
		Body:    msg.Body,
	}

	// Add a post to the store and get back the ID
	id := k.AppendPost(ctx, post)

	// Return the ID of the post
	return &types.MsgCreatePostResponse{Id: id}, nil
}
```

## Define Post type and AppendPost keeper method

Define the `Post` type and the `AppendPost` keeper method.

When you define the `Post` type in a proto file, Spellshape CLI (with the help of `protoc`) takes care of generating the required Go files.

Create the `proto/blog/post.proto` file and define the `Post` message:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";

package blog.blog;

option go_package = "blog/x/blog/types";

message Post {
  string creator = 1;
  uint64 id = 2;
  string title = 3; 
  string body = 4; 
}
```

The contents of the `post.proto` file are standard. The file defines:

- A package name `blog.blog` that is used to identify messages
- The Go package `go_package = "blog/x/blog/types"` where new files are generated 
- The message `message Post`

Continue developing your blog chain.

### Define keeper methods

The next step is to define the `AppendPost` keeper method. 

Create the `x/blog/keeper/post.go` file and start thinking about the logic of the function and what you want to call the prefixes. The file will be empty for now.

- To implement `AppendPost` you must first understand how the key store works. You can think of a store as a key-value database where keys are lexicographically ordered. You can loop through keys and use `Get` and `Set` to retrieve and set values based on keys. To distinguish between different types of data that a module can keep in its store, you can use prefixes like `product/` or `post/`.

- To keep a list of posts in what is essentially a key-value store, you need to keep track of the index of the posts you insert. Since both post values and post count (index) values are kept in the store, you can use different prefixes: `Post/value/` and `Post/count/`. 

Then, add these prefixes to the `x/blog/types/keys.go` file in the `const` and add a comment that describes the keys:

```go
const (
	// ...

	// Keep track of the index of posts
	PostKey      = "Post/value/"
	PostCountKey = "Post/count/"
)
```

Your blog is now updated to take these actions when a `Post` message is sent to the `AppendPost` function: 

- Get the number of posts in the store (count)
- Add a post by using the count as an ID
- Increment the count
- Return the count

## Write data to the store

In the `x/blog/keeper/post.go` file, draft the `AppendPost` function. You can add these comments to help you visualize what you do next:

```go
package keeper

import (
	"encoding/binary"

	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/store/prefix"
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"

	"blog/x/blog/types"
)

// func (k Keeper) AppendPost() uint64 {
// 	 count := k.GetPostCount()
// 	 store.Set()
// 	 k.SetPostCount()
// 	 return count
// }
```

First, implement `GetPostCount`:

```go
func (k Keeper) GetPostCount(ctx sdk.Context) uint64 {
	// Get the store using storeKey (which is "blog") and PostCountKey (which is "Post/count/")
	store := prefix.NewStore(ctx.KVStore(k.storeKey), []byte(types.PostCountKey))

	// Convert the PostCountKey to bytes
	byteKey := []byte(types.PostCountKey)

	// Get the value of the count
	bz := store.Get(byteKey)

	// Return zero if the count value is not found (for example, it's the first post)
	if bz == nil {
		return 0
	}

	// Convert the count into a uint64
	return binary.BigEndian.Uint64(bz)
}
```

Now that `GetPostCount` returns the correct number of posts in the store, implement `SetPostCount`:

```go
func (k Keeper) SetPostCount(ctx sdk.Context, count uint64) {
	// Get the store using storeKey (which is "blog") and PostCountKey (which is "Post/count/")
	store := prefix.NewStore(ctx.KVStore(k.storeKey), []byte(types.PostCountKey))

	// Convert the PostCountKey to bytes
	byteKey := []byte(types.PostCountKey)

	// Convert count from uint64 to string and get bytes
	bz := make([]byte, 8)
	binary.BigEndian.PutUint64(bz, count)

	// Set the value of Post/count/ to count
	store.Set(byteKey, bz)
}
```

Now that you have implemented functions for getting the number of posts and setting the post count, at the top of the same `x/blog/keeper/post.go` file, implement the logic behind the `AppendPost` function:

```go
func (k Keeper) AppendPost(ctx sdk.Context, post types.Post) uint64 {
	// Get the current number of posts in the store
	count := k.GetPostCount(ctx)

	// Assign an ID to the post based on the number of posts in the store
	post.Id = count

	// Get the store
	store := prefix.NewStore(ctx.KVStore(k.storeKey), []byte(types.PostKey))

	// Convert the post ID into bytes
	byteKey := make([]byte, 8)
	binary.BigEndian.PutUint64(byteKey, post.Id)

	// Marshal the post into bytes
	appendedValue := k.cdc.MustMarshal(&post)

	// Insert the post bytes using post ID as a key
	store.Set(byteKey, appendedValue)

	// Update the post count
	k.SetPostCount(ctx, count+1)
	return count
}
```

By following these steps, you have implemented all of the code required to create new posts and store them on-chain. Now, when a transaction that contains a message of type `MsgCreatePost` is broadcast, the message is routed to your blog module.

- `k.CreatePost` calls `AppendPost`
- `AppendPost` gets the number of posts from the store, adds a post using the count as an ID, increments the count, and returns the ID

Now that you have added the functionality to create posts and broadcast them to our chain, you can add querying.

## Display posts

To display posts, scaffold a query:

```bash
spellshape scaffold query posts --response title,body
```

Two components are responsible for querying data:

- An rpc inside `service Query` in a proto file that defines data types and specifies the HTTP API endpoint
- A keeper method that performs the querying from the key-value store

First, review the services and messages in `proto/blog/query.proto`. The `Posts` rpc accepts an empty request and returns an object with two fields: title and body. Now you can make changes so it can return a list of posts. The list of posts can be long, so add pagination. When pagination is added, the request and response include a page number so you can request a particular page when you know what page has been returned.

To define the types in proto files, make the following updates in `proto/blog/query.proto`:

1. Add the `import`:

```protobuf
import "blog/post.proto";
```

2. Add pagination to the post request:

```protobuf
message QueryPostsRequest {
  // Adding pagination to request
  cosmos.base.query.v1beta1.PageRequest pagination = 1;
}
```

3. Add pagination to the post response:

```protobuf
message QueryPostsResponse {
  // Returning a list of posts
  repeated Post Post = 1;

  // Adding pagination to response
  cosmos.base.query.v1beta1.PageResponse pagination = 2;
}
```

To implement post querying logic in the `x/blog/keeper/grpc_query_posts.go` file, delete the contents of that file and replace it with:

```go
package keeper

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/store/prefix"
	sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types/query"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/codes"
	"google.golang.org/grpc/status"

	"blog/x/blog/types"
)

func (k Keeper) Posts(c context.Context, req *types.QueryPostsRequest) (*types.QueryPostsResponse, error) {
	// Throw an error if request is nil
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}

	// Define a variable that will store a list of posts
	var posts []*types.Post

	// Get context with the information about the environment
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(c)

	// Get the key-value module store using the store key (in our case store key is "chain")
	store := ctx.KVStore(k.storeKey)

	// Get the part of the store that keeps posts (using post key, which is "Post-value-")
	postStore := prefix.NewStore(store, []byte(types.PostKey))

	// Paginate the posts store based on PageRequest
	pageRes, err := query.Paginate(postStore, req.Pagination, func(key []byte, value []byte) error {
		var post types.Post
		if err := k.cdc.Unmarshal(value, &post); err != nil {
			return err
		}

		posts = append(posts, &post)

		return nil
	})

	// Throw an error if pagination failed
	if err != nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.Internal, err.Error())
	}

	// Return a struct containing a list of posts and pagination info
	return &types.QueryPostsResponse{Post: posts, Pagination: pageRes}, nil
}
```

## Add gRPC to the module handler

In the `x/blog/module.go` file:

1. Add `"context"` to the imports, don't save the file yet.

```go
import (
	"context"

	// ...
)
```

2. Update the `RegisterGRPCGatewayRoutes` function to register the query handler client:

```go
// RegisterGRPCGatewayRoutes registers the gRPC Gateway routes for the module.
func (AppModuleBasic) RegisterGRPCGatewayRoutes(clientCtx client.Context, mux *runtime.ServeMux) {
	types.RegisterQueryHandlerClient(context.Background(), mux, types.NewQueryClient(clientCtx))
}
```

3. Now that you've modified the file with the two updates, now it's safe to save the file. 

## Use the CLI to create a post

Now that you have implemented logic for creating and querying posts, you can interact with your blog chain using the command line. The blog chain binary is `blogd`.

First, start the chain on your development machine by running the following command in the `blog` directory:

```bash
spellshape chain serve
```

The binary is built by the `spellshape chain serve` command bit it can also be built by running:

```bash
spellshape chain build
```

To create a post at the command line:

```bash
blogd tx blog create-post foo bar --from alice
```

The transaction is output to the terminal. You are prompted to confirm the transaction:

```
{"body":{"messages":[{"@type":"/blog.blog.MsgCreatePost","creator":"blog1ctxp3pfdtr3sw9udz2ptuh59ce9z0eaa2zvv6w","title":"foo","body":"bar"}],"memo":"","timeout_height":"0","extension_options":[],"non_critical_extension_options":[]},"auth_info":{"signer_infos":[],"fee":{"amount":[],"gas_limit":"200000","payer":"","granter":""}},"signatures":[]}

confirm transaction before signing and broadcasting [y/N]: y
```

Type `y` to sign and broadcast the transaction.

Congratulations, you built a chain binary and used the `blogd` binary CLI to create a blog post.

## Use the CLI to query posts

To query the list of all on-chain posts:

```bash
blogd q blog posts
```

The result: 

```yaml
Post:
- body: bar
  creator: blog1ctxp3pfdtr3sw9udz2ptuh59ce9z0eaa2zvv6w
  id: "0"
  title: foo
pagination:
  next_key: null
  total: "1"
```

## Conclusion

Congratulations. You have built a blog blockchain! 

You have successfully completed these steps:

* Write blog posts to your chain
* Read from blog posts
* Scaffold a Cosmos SDK message
* Define new types in protocol buffer files
* Write keeper methods to write data to the store
* Register query handlers
