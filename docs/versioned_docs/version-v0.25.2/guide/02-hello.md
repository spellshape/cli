# Hello, Spellshape CLI 

This tutorial is a great place to start your journey into the Cosmos ecosystem. Instead of wondering how to build a blockchain, follow these steps to build your first blockchain and your first Cosmos SDK module.

## Get started

In the previous chapter you've learned how to install [Spellshape CLI](https://github.com/spellshape/cli), the tool that offers everything you need to build, test, and launch your blockchain with a decentralized worldwide community.

This series of tutorials is based on a specific version of Spellshape CLI, so be sure to install the correct version. For example, to install Spellshape CLI v0.22.2 use the following command:

```bash
curl https://get.spellshape.com/cli@v0.22.2! | bash
```

Spellshape CLI comes with a number of scaffolding commands that are designed to make development easier by creating everything that's required to start working on a particular task.

First, use Spellshape CLI to build the foundation of a fresh Cosmos SDK blockchain. With Spellshape CLI, you don't have to write the blockchain code yourself. 

Are you ready? Open a terminal window and navigate to a directory where you have permissions to create files. 

To create your blockchain with the default directory structure, run this command:

```bash
spellshape scaffold chain hello
```

This command creates a Cosmos SDK blockchain called hello in a `hello` directory. The source code inside the `hello` directory contains a fully functional ready-to-use blockchain.

This new blockchain imports standard Cosmos SDK modules, including:

- [`staking`](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/staking) for delegated Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism
- [`bank`](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/bank) for fungible token transfers between accounts
- [`gov`](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules/gov) for on-chain governance
- And other Cosmos SDK [modules](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/modules) that provide the benefits of the extensive Cosmos SDK framework 

You can get help on any command. Now that you have run your first command, take a minute to see all of the command line options for the `scaffold` command.  

To learn about the command you just used, run:

```bash
spellshape scaffold --help
```

## Blockchain directory structure

After you create the blockchain, switch to its directory:

```bash
cd hello
```

The `hello` directory contains a number of generated files and directories that make up the structure of a Cosmos SDK blockchain. Most of the work in this tutorial happens in the `x` directory. Here is a quick overview of files and directories that are created by default:

| File/directory | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| app/           | Files that wire together the blockchain. The most important file is `app.go` that contains type definition of the blockchain and functions to create and initialize it. |
| cmd/           | The main package responsible for the CLI of compiled binary.                                                                                                            |
| docs/          | Directory for project documentation. By default, an OpenAPI spec is generated.                                                                                          |
| proto/         | Protocol buffer files describing the data structure.                                                                                                                    |
| testutil/      | Helper functions for testing.                                                                                                                                           |
| vue/           | A Vue 3 web app template.                                                                                                                                               |
| x/             | Cosmos SDK modules and custom modules.                                                                                                                                  |
| config.yml     | A configuration file for customizing a chain in development.                                                                                                            |
| readme.md      | A readme file for your sovereign application-specific blockchain project.                                                                                               |

Now you can get your blockchain up and running locally on a single node.

## Start a blockchain

You already have a fully-functional blockchain. To start your chain on your development machine, run the following command in the `hello` directory

```bash
spellshape chain serve
```

This command downloads dependencies and compiles the source code into a binary called `hellod`. By default, the binary name is the name of the repo + `d`. From now on, use this `hellod` binary to run all of your chain commands. For example, to initialize a single validator node and start a node.

Leave this terminal window open while your chain is running.

## HTTP API Console

By default, a validator node exposes two API endpoints:

- [http://localhost:26657](http://localhost:26657) for the low-level Tendermint API
- [http://localhost:1317](http://localhost:1317) for the high-level blockchain API

Now that you started your `hello` chain, use a web browser to see the high-level `hello` blockchain API:

![./images/api.png](./images/api.png)

## Stop a blockchain

When you want to stop your blockchain, press Ctrl+C in the terminal window where it's running.

In the development environment, you can experiment and instantly see updates. You don't have to restart the blockchain after you make changes. Hot reloading automatically detects all of the changes you make in the `hello` directory files.

## Say "Hello, Spellshape CLI"

To get your blockchain to say `Hello! Spellshape CLI`, you need to make these changes:

- Modify a protocol buffer file
- Create a keeper query function that returns data
- Register a query function

Protocol buffer files contain proto rpc calls that define Cosmos SDK queries and message handlers, and proto messages that define Cosmos SDK types. The rpc calls are also responsible for exposing an HTTP API.

For each Cosmos SDK module, the [Keeper](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-modules/keeper.html) is an abstraction for modifying the state of the blockchain. Keeper functions let you query or write to the state. After you add the first query to your chain, the next step is to register the query. You only need to register a query once.

A typical blockchain developer workflow looks something like this:

- Start with proto files to define Cosmos SDK [messages](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-modules/msg-services.html)
- Define and register [queries](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/building-modules/query-services.html)
- Define message handler logic
- Finally, implement the logic of these queries and message handlers in keeper functions

## Create a query

For all subsequent commands, use a terminal window that is different from the window you started the chain in. 

In a different terminal window, run the commands in your `hello` directory.

Create a `hello` query:

```bash
spellshape scaffold query hello --response text
```

`query` accepts a name of the query (in this case, `hello`), an optional list of request parameters (in this case, empty), and an optional comma-separated list of response fields with a `--response` flag (in this case, `text`).

The `query` command has created and modified several files:

```
modify proto/hello/query.proto
modify x/hello/client/cli/query.go
create x/hello/client/cli/query_hello.go
create x/hello/keeper/grpc_query_hello.go
```

Let's examine some of these changes. For clarity, the following code blocks do not show the placeholder comments that Spellshape CLI uses to scaffold code. Don't delete these placeholders since they are required to continue using Spellshape CLI's scaffolding functionality.

Note: it's recommended to commit changes to a version control system (for example, Git) after scaffolding. This allows others to easily distinguish between code generated by Spellshape and the code writen by hand.

```
git add .
git commit -am "Scaffolded a hello query with Spellshape CLI"
```

### Updates to the query service

In the `proto/hello/query.proto` file, the `Hello` rpc has been added to the `Query` service.

```protobuf
service Query {
	rpc Hello(QueryHelloRequest) returns (QueryHelloResponse) {
		option (google.api.http).get = "/hello/hello/hello";
	}
}
```

Here's how the `Hello` rpc for the `Query` service works:

- Is responsible for returning a `text` string
- Accepts request parameters (`QueryHelloRequest`)
- Returns response of type `QueryHelloResponse`
- The `option` defines the endpoint that is used by gRPC to generate an HTTP API

### Request and reponse types

Now, take a look at the following request and response types:

```protobuf
message QueryHelloRequest {
}

message QueryHelloResponse {
  string text = 1;
}
```

- The `QueryHelloRequest` message is empty because this request does not require parameters.
- The `QueryHelloResponse` message contains `text` that is returned from the chain.

## Hello keeper function

The `x/hello/keeper/grpc_query_hello.go` file contains the `Hello` keeper function that handles the query and returns data.

```go
func (k Keeper) Hello(goCtx context.Context, req *types.QueryHelloRequest) (*types.QueryHelloResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryHelloResponse{}, nil
}
```

The `Hello` function performs these actions:

- Makes a basic check on the request and throws an error if it's `nil`
- Stores context in a `ctx` variable that contains information about the environment of the request
- Returns a response of type `QueryHelloResponse`

Right now the response is empty.

### Update keeper function

In the `query.proto` file, the response accepts `text`. 

- Use a text editor to modify the `x/hello/keeper/grpc_query_hello.go` file that contains the keeper function. 
- On the last line of the keeper function, change the line to return "Hello, Spellshape CLI!":

```go
func (k Keeper) Hello(c context.Context, req *types.QueryHelloRequest) (*types.QueryHelloResponse, error) {
	if req == nil {
		return nil, status.Error(codes.InvalidArgument, "invalid request")
	}
	ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(goCtx)
	_ = ctx
	return &types.QueryHelloResponse{Text: "Hello, Spellshape CLI!"}, nil // <--
}
```

- Save the file to restart your chain. 
- In a web browser, visit the `hello` endpoint [http://localhost:1317/hello/hello/hello](http://localhost:1317/hello/hello/hello).

  Because the query handlers are not yet registered with gRPC, you see a not implemented or localhost cannot connect error. This error is expected behavior, because you still need to register the query handlers.

## Register query handlers

Make the required changes to the `x/hello/module.go` file.

1. Add `"context"` to the list of packages in the import statement.

    ```go
	import (
		// ...

		"context"

		// ...
	)
    ```

    Do not save the file yet, you need to continue with these modifications.

1. Search for `RegisterGRPCGatewayRoutes`.

1. Register the query handlers:

    ```go
	func (AppModuleBasic) RegisterGRPCGatewayRoutes(clientCtx client.Context, mux *runtime.ServeMux) {
		types.RegisterQueryHandlerClient(context.Background(), mux, types.NewQueryClient(clientCtx))
	}
    ```

2. After the chain has been started, visit [http://localhost:1317/hello/hello/hello](http://localhost:1317/hello/hello/hello) and see your text displayed:

    ```json
    {
      "text": "Hello, Spellshape CLI!",
    }
    ```

The `query` command has also scaffolded `x/hello/client/cli/query_hello.go` that implements a CLI equivalent of the hello query and mounted this command in `x/hello/client/cli/query.go` . Run the following command and get the same JSON response:

```bash
hellod q hello hello
```

Congratulations, you have built your first blockchain and your first Cosmos SDK module. Continue the journey to learn more about scaffolding Cosmos SDK messages, types in protocol buffer files, the keeper, and more.
