You'll see release details like the following output:

Modify the title by changing the contents of the `<title>` tag:

```protobuf
// ...

message Post {
  string creator = 1;
  string id = 2;
  string title = 3; 
  string body = 4; 
}

message MsgCreatePost {
  string creator = 1;
  string title = 2; 
  string body = 3; 
}

// ...
```

Now transition to the next step by telling the user what's next.

<!------------ Formatting ------------------------->

<!-- Some examples of how to mark up various things

This is _italics_ and this is **bold**.

Use italics and bold for specific things. 

This is `inline code`. Use single tick marks for filenames and commands.

Here's a command you can type on a command line:

```bash
which go
```

Here's output from a command:

```
/usr/local/go/bin/go
```

Write key presses in ALLCAPS.

Use a plus symbol (+) if keys need to be pressed simultaneously: `CTRL+C`.

**Note:** This is a note.

**Tip:** This is a tip.

Add diagrams and screenshots in PNG format with a self-describing filename. Embed them in the article using the following format:
