# Bounty program

Our Spellshape CLI bounty program provides incentives for your participation and pays rewards. If you know Golang, follow the bounty issues, write code, close issues, and get rewarded.

Do your bounty hunting in our repo. Track new, in-progress, and completed bounties on the [Bounty board](https://github.com/spellshape/cli/projects/5) in GitHub.

For details on the Spellshape CLI bounty program, join the #bounty channel in [Spellshape Discord](https://discord.com/invite/spellshape).

New bounties are posted and claimed in Discord on the #bounty announcement channel.
