# Welcome to Spellshape CLI ‚ú®

Spellshape CLI is an easy-to-use CLI tool for creating sovereign blockchains. Blockchains created with Spellshape CLI use Cosmos SDK, the world's most widely used blockchain application framework.

In this browser-based development environment, the terminal window is in the lower part of the window. The `spellshape` binary is pre-installed and ready to use on the command line.

## Quick start
